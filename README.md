Hi. Iâ€™m Vijay Kumar Chauhan. I build lots of sampe appication on this account which helps developer to know about programming languages.I also like to do hand dust on new programming languages and share it with by creating demo examples, blogs or trainings. Most of them are built live on Learn With Jason, a live-streamed pair programming show where super smart people join to teach us something new in 90 minutes.

I work at Maharashtra Knowledge Corporation Limitted (MKCL) as a Senior Tech Lead.
